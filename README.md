# Nocturne v2
Nocturne v2 will be powered by the following stack;

## Backend
- Crystal
    - REST API
    - GraphQL API

Looking at Onyx instead of Amber because of Onyx::REST and the chance of it being a lot less bloated >.>
[Awesome Crystal Web Frameworks](https://github.com/veelenga/awesome-crystal#web-frameworks)

Currently looking at;
- Onyx
- Amber

## Frontend
- Vue.js
    - The Crystal Backend will do two things;
        - Provide an API to interact with models
        - Provide routing for the views
    - Everything else will be handled by Vue :D
- Bulma
    - Because doing my website from scratch by myself is proving a little too difficult to ever want to repeat it >.>
